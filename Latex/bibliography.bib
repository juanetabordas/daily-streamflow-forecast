	ABSTRACT={The Andes is the longest cordillera in the world and extends from northern South America to the southern extreme of the continent (from 11°N to 53°S). The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension. This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people. In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth. From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment. In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range. This review paper is presented in two parts. Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation. Part II, which is also included in the research topic “Connecting Mountain Hydroclimate Through the American Cordilleras,” focuses on the hydroclimate variability of the Andes at the sub-continental scale, including the effects of El Niño-Southern Oscillation.}

	ABSTRACT={This paper provides an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature related to the hydroclimate of the Andes. The Andes, the longest cordillera in the world, faces major challenges regarding climate variability and climate change, which impose several threats to sustainable development, including water supply and the sustainability of ecosystem services. This review focuses on hydroclimate variability of the Andes at a sub-continental scale. The annual water cycle and long-term water balance along the Andes are addressed first, followed by the examination of the effects of orography on convective and frontal precipitation through the study of precipitation gradients in the tropical, subtropical and extratropical Andes. In addition, a review is presented of the current scientific literature on the climate variability in the Andes at different timescales. Finally, open research questions are presented in the last section of this article.}

	ABSTRACT={Owing to the extraordinary latitudinal extent, a strong orographic variability with very high mountain tops, and the presence of deep valleys and steep slopes, the Andes and the population of the region are highly prone and vulnerable to the impacts of a large suite of extreme weather events. Here we provide a review of the most salient events in terms of losses of human and animal lives, economic and monetary losses in costs and damages, and social disruption, namely: (1) extreme precipitation events and related processes (Mesoscale Convective Systems, lightning), (2) cold spells, frosts, and high winds, (3) the impacts of ENSO on extreme hydro-meteorological events, (4) floods, (5) landslides, mudslides, avalanches, and (6) droughts, heat waves and fires. For our purposes, we focus this review on three distinctive regions along the Andes: Northern tropical (north of 8°S), Southern tropical (8°S-27°S) and Extratropical Andes (south of 27°S). Research gaps are also identified and discussed at the end of this review. It is very likely that climate change will increase the vulnerability of the millions of inhabitants of the Andes, impacting their livelihoods and the sustainable development of the region into the twenty first century amidst urbanization, deforestation, air, soil and water pollution, and land use changes.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The Easterly Waves (EWs) have been highlighted as one of the different spatiotemporal processes that influence hydro-climatology over northern South America and the Caribbean Sea, particularly during boreal summer. Previous studies recognize the EWs among the most important features of the rainy season in northern South America, suggesting the occurrence of precipitation as the main meteorological response to the passage of these disturbances. However, it is shown in this work that not all the EWs that propagate over northern South America and the Caribbean Sea have such an effect. Almost 50\% of the EWs moving over the region during the 1983–2018 period were accompanied by the inhibition of precipitation and clear skies, as depicted by anomalies from the Climate Data Record of Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks precipitation dataset and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration interpolated Outgoing Longwave Radiation dataset. This work intends to address the relationship between these atmospheric perturbations and the occurrence or inhibition of precipitation, as well as a plausible connection with the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). In particular, horizontal components of wind and relative vorticity, together with low and upper troposphere divergence, were used to identify and characterize the EW activity over northern South America and the Caribbean Sea. Results suggest an influence of the MJO on the effects that the EWs have on convection and precipitation over the region, as well as the direction in which such perturbances continue their westward propagation.},

We used linear Pearson cross-correlation, wavelet and cross wavelet analysis (CWA) and three nonlinear causality methods: ParrCorr, GPDC and PCMCIplus. Results showed that NDVI peaks when SMOS is transitioning from maximum to minimum monthly values, which confirms the role of SMOS in the hydrological dynamics of the Amazonian greening up during the dry season. Linear correlations showed significant positive values when SMOS leads NDVI by 1&ndash;3 months. Wavelet analysis evidenced strong 12- and 64-month frequency bands throughout the entire record length, in particular for SMOS, whereas the CWA analyses indicated that both variables exhibit a strong coherency at a wide range of frequency bands from 2 to 32 months. Linear and nonlinear causality measures also showed that ENSO effects are greater on SMOS. Lagged cross-correlations displayed that western (eastern) regions are more associated with the CP (EP), and that the effects of ENSO manifest as a travelling wave over time, from northwest (earlier) to southeast (later) over tropical South America and the Amazon River basin. The ParrCorr and PCMCIplus methods produced the most coherent results, and allowed us to conclude that: (1) the nonlinear temporal persistence (memory) of soil moisture is stronger than that of NDVI; (2) the existence of two-way nonlinear causalities between NDVI and SMOS; (3) diverse causal links between both variables and the ENSO indices: CP (7/12 with ParrCorr; 6/12 with PCMCIplus), and less with EP (5/12 with ParrCorr; 3/12 with PCMCIplus).},

	ABSTRACT={The spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in regions of complex mountainous terrains constitutes one of the most challenging research topics of geosciences. This paper explores hourly precipitation data from a set of 25 stations spanning the period 1998 to 2005 within northwestern Colombia, in the Aburrá Valley and the neighboring San Nicolás plateau (75.16°W−6°N and 75.66°W−6.6°N) which accounts for a land area of ~4,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Our aim is to identify the main features of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over this complex terrain. We found that the average diurnal cycle of rainfall in the study region is bimodal at regional scale although it results from the superposition of two unimodal diurnal cycles shifting its phase throughout the seasons of the year. From October to April, average diurnal rainfall peaks in the afternoon hours (13:00–16:00 LST) but from May to September, the phase of the diurnal cycle changes to midnight hours (22:00–02:00 LST). Three low-level jets (LLJs), namely Caribbean, CHOCO, and the so-called Corriente de los Andes Orientales (CAO), are relevant to explain the seasonal shift of the diurnal cycle given their modulation of the seasonal variation of moisture sources and transport over this region. During June-July-August, moisture from afternoon evaporation processes at the bottom of the inter-Andean Magdalena Valley, located at the east of the study region, is transported by anabatic and easterly trade winds and contribute to explain the midnight and early morning peak. The life cycle of convective processes influences the orographic nature of rainfall distribution and timing in the region since deep convective cores are related with the afternoon peak, whereas wide convective cores with the early morning peak.}

	abstract = {A relevant climate feature of the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS) is the low-level jet (IALLJ) dominating the IAS circulation, both in summer and winter; and yet it is practically unknown with regard to its nature, structure, interactions with mid-latitude and tropical phenomena, and its role in regional weather and climate. This paper updates IALLJ current knowledge and its contribution to IAS circulation–precipitation patterns and presents recent findings about the IALLJ based on first in situ observations during Phase 3 of the Experimento Climático en las Albercas de Agua Cálida (ECAC), an international field campaign to study IALLJ dynamics during July 2001. Nonhydrostatic fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) simulations were compared with observations and reanalysis. Large-scale circulation patterns of the IALLJ northern hemisphere summer and winter components suggest that trades, and so the IALLJ, are responding to land–ocean thermal contrasts during the summer season of each continent. The IALLJ is a natural component of the American monsoons as a result of the continent's approximate north–south land distribution. During warm (cold) El Niño–Southern Oscillation phases, winds associated with the IALLJ core (IALLJC) are stronger (weaker) than normal, so precipitation anomalies are positive (negative) in the western Caribbean near Central America and negative (positive) in the central IAS. During the ECAC Phase 3, strong surface winds associated with the IALLJ induced upwelling, cooling down the sea surface temperature by 1–2 °C. The atmospheric mixed layer height reached 1 km near the surface wind maximum below the IALLJC. Observations indicate that primary water vapor advection takes place in a shallow layer between the IALLJC and the ocean surface. Latent heat flux peaked below the IALLJC. Neither the reanalysis nor MM5 captured the observed thermodynamic and kinematic IALLJ structure. So far, IALLJ knowledge is based on either dynamically initialized data or simulations of global (regional) models, which implies that a more systematic and scientific approach is needed to improve it. The Intra-Americas Study of Climate Processes is a great regional opportunity to address trough field work, modeling, and process studies, many of the IALLJ unknown features.},

	abstract = {We study the seasonal dynamics of the eastern Pacific (CHOCO) and Caribbean low-level jets (LLJ), and aerial rivers (AR) acting on tropical and subtropical South America. Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979–2012), we show that the convergence of both LLJs over the eastern Pacific-western Colombia contributes to the explanation of the region's world-record rainfall. Diverse variables involved in the transport and storage of moisture permit the identification of an AR over northern South America involving a midtropospheric easterly jet that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Andes, with stronger activity in April to August. Other major seasonal AR pathways constitute part of a large gyre originating over the tropical North Atlantic, veering to the southeast over the eastern Andes and reaching regions of northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. We illustrate the distribution of average seasonal precipitation along the LLJs and AR pathways with data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (1998–2011), combined with considerations of CAPE, topography, and land cover. In addition, the theory of the biotic pump of atmospheric moisture (BiPAM) is tested at seasonal time scales, and found to hold in 8 out of 12 ARs, and 22 out of 32 forest-covered tracks (64\% in distance) along the ARs. Deviations from BiPAM's predictions of rainfall distribution are explained by the effects of topography, orography, and land cover types different from forests. Our results lend a strong observational support to the BiPAM theory at seasonal time scales over South American forested flat lands.},

	abstract = {Abstract Surface and atmospheric water balances analysis for Amazon River basin at monthly time scale are performed with an emphasis on the linkages between the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Analyses are performed using observational and reanalysis data covering five different periods of analysis (depending on length of evapotranspiration data sets) for the entire basin, major subcatchments, and for the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Results for the entire basin show a state close to balance within tolerance, while the spatial disaggregation produced a less clear picture, presenting major discrepancies between observations and reanalysis data sets. The atmospheric budget exhibits no closure and positive residuals regardless of data set, with the magnitude of residuals for the entire Amazon basin highly dependent on evapotranspiration data source. The imbalance between the two water budgets (14\%–16\%) is driven by higher values of runoff and by an abrupt change in runoff when changing from dry to wet seasons in the Amazon. We unveil two shortcomings of the available data, namely poor quality in the representation of surface processes by reanalysis, and flaws and scarcity of information in the high Andes that induce uncertainties and errors in both water budgets. The results of the present study highlight the importance of the Andean region for the hydrological integrity of the entire Amazon River basin. Our results confirm the paramount importance of the joint analysis of atmospheric and surface water budgets at the basin level with respect to achieving a complete understanding of the whole hydrological cycle at the continental scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},
